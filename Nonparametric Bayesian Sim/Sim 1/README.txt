Description:

Repository includes simulation of a mobile target following several different behaviors including:
1) “Busy bodied”
2) Aggressive
3) Shy 
4) Combinations of above

Goal: 
Generate pose data to train a search agent on several behaviors using Nonparametric Bayesian Gaussian Process techniques to generate more robust control structure. 

Stretch Goals: 
Incorporate human input as sensor data to fuse with onboard measurements and control structure.
