Description: Simulation of pose and velocity estimates for a robot (point mass model) based on measurements of IMU measurements, optical flow body frame velocity sensor, and a range and heading measurement to several beacons in the environment. An extended Kalman filter is used for estimation in this simulation.

The model used for implementation for a quadrotor has been omitted due to requirements from AFRL. This simulation was used as an introduction to EKFs.
